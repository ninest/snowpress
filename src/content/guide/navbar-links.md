title: Navbar links
---

Navbar links can be added in `siteConfig.yml`. Here's an example of the `siteConfig.yml`:

```yml
navLinks:
  - title: Guide
    url: /guide
  - title: Examples
    url: /examples
```

To add another link, for example, `/advanced`, add an appropriate title and URL:

```yml
navLinks:
  - title: Guide
    url: /guide
  - title: Examples
    url: /examples
  - title: Advanced
    url: /advanced
```
