For the past 5 years I have seen my fair share of nsf come and go. I always treat them like brothers, I don't care or bother about them addressing to me by my rank, Cause deep down in my heart I know that they are doing their part, but when the time comes for them to Ord it always hits me. They always will say 'see you outside when Ord to me' hahaha cause somehow they know I am tired of being a regular. The stupid things we did will never be forgotten and will always be close to my heart.

I'm a bored NSF and I have nothing to do, so I compiled a list of (reddit) links that will hopefully be helpful/entertaining to new recruits. I've also converted this to a website. View the code for it here.

## Section

This is going to be a long post, but here goes. It all started when I was in a meeting with the unit commanders, and I decided to acknowledge my trainer just by his appointment only, no rank no name. An encik caught on to this and gave me a lecture about how we should address people properly, by their appointment and title, or with names and so on. For example, you can call a warrant officer by "Trainer Encik Tan", "Encik Tan", or "warrant Tan" and never "Trainer", "Trainer Tan" or even worse, "2nd warrant officer Tan Ah Kow".

## Yet another 
Just a rant. Learnet is extremely painful to use. Every second of using it is utter misery. You’d think that having implemented the system for over 6 years now, and after numerous complaints from everyone serving - commanders or men, that something would’ve been done to at least TRY and improve the user experience. Nope. Even in 2020, this shit still feels primitive. I’ve never heard anything positive about learnet.
